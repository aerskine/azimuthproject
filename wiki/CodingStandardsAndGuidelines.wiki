# Coding Standards and Guidelines

= Introduction =

Every software project needs coding standards and guidelines. There are two kinds of standards:

- those who try to encourage good coding practices that lead to leaner and understandable code,

- those who try to encourage certain conventions that will make the code easier to read because different developers will implement similar things in a similar way, although there are several different equally fitting ways to do it.

We will address both aspects and provide links to pages with more details.

There are of course a lot of coding standards that other projects already defined, here we will link to those that we recommend:

- Java Coding Standards:

For Java project we encourage the use of
