# Coding Standards and Guidelines

= Introduction =

Every software project needs coding standards and guidelines. There are two kinds of standards:

- those who try to encourage good coding practices that lead to leaner and understandable code,

- those who try to encourage certain conventions that will make the code easier to read because different developers will implement similar things in a similar way, although there are several different equally fitting ways to do it.

We will address both aspects and provide links to pages with more details.
