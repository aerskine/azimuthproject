#Lists open coding problems from the Azimuth project

= Introduction =

This page lists the currently open coding challenges, these are problem descriptions from the Azimuth project that still need a convincing solution.


= Challenges =

== The Delayed Action Oscillator ==

See the paper [http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0603083 El Nino and the Delayed Action Oscillator]

Challenge: Implement a numerical solution of the delayed differential equations of the paper and reproduce the graphics.
