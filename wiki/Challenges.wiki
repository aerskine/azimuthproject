#Lists open coding problems from the Azimuth project

= Introduction =

This page lists the currently open coding challenges, these are problem descriptions from the Azimuth project that still need a convincing solution. 

Convincing solutions may be used to publish expository or research articles in various forms with full credit to the author(s), for examples see the solved challenges page.

Background material to the underlying science, mathematics and implementation issues will be provided.


= Challenges =

== The Delayed Action Oscillator ==

=== References to the Scientific Background ===
See the paper [http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0603083 El Nino and the Delayed Action Oscillator].

For more background see the page about El Nino on the Azimuth project: [http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/ENSO ENSO].

=== References to Mathematical and Implementation Issues ===
There is a page about delayed differential equations (both stochastic and deterministic) on the Azimuth project:

[http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stochastic+delay+differential+equation Stochastic delay differential equation]

=== Challenge ===
Implement a numerical solution of the delayed differential equations of the paper and reproduce the graphics.
