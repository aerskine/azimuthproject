== Two Dimensional Hopf Bifurcation for El Nino ==

This challenge is about a model of El Nino, a quasi-periodic climate phenomenon that occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean every 3 to 7 years, and on average every 4 years.

The model uses a two dimensional system of ordinary differential equations with noise, with a Hopf bifurcation.

For more background see the page about El Nino on the Azimuth project: [http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/ENSO ENSO].

=== Challenge ===
Implement a numerical solution of the SDE system with Hopf bifurcation.

=== Solution ===
The solution was implemented in the component azimuth-sde-models, results were published on the Aziumth blog [here http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/this-weeks-finds-week-308/].
