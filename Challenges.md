**Caution:** this page is no longer actively maintained. The interested reader should consult the [relevant Azimuth wiki page](http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Code+Challenges).

# Introduction #

This page lists the currently open coding challenges, these are problem descriptions from the Azimuth project that still need a convincing solution.

Convincing solutions may be used to publish expository or research articles in various forms with full credit to the author(s), for examples see the solved challenges page.

Background material to the underlying science, mathematics and implementation issues will be provided.


# Challenges #

## **The Delayed Action Oscillator** ##

This challenge is about a model of El Nino, a quasi-periodic climate phenomenon that occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean every 3 to 7 years, and on average every 4 years.
The model uses a low dimensional (in fact: one dimensional) system of ordinary delay differential equations to capture the interaction of the Pacific Ocean (slow process with a long memory) and the atmosphere (quickly varying process with almost not memory).
